            <h2>SigEp: A Portrait of Excellence</h2>
            <p>
              This fraternity is different. Everyday every SigEp works to exude
              excellence in every sense of the word. Every SigEp is an athlete,
              a scholar, a leader and a gentleman. This Balanced Man philosophy,
              which will ask you to be sound in both mind and body, has been the
              model of our success.
            </p>
            <p>
              SigEp has won four of the last five Dean’s Cups, an award given to
              the best fraternity on campus. SigEp won Greek Week in 2012 and
              2013, a week of stiff competition in athletics and creativity
              between all Drexel fraternities. With a cumulative GPA of 3.33,
              SigEp boasts a GPA .23 higher than the average fraternity at
              Drexel. In 2012 SigEp won IFC Flag Football, and appeared in 5 IFC
              Championships, in basketball, floor hockey, billiards, softball
              and soccer. SigEp has been in basketball championship finals 3 of
              the previous 4 seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              SigEp is composed of campus leaders including this year’s USGA
              President and the former IFC President. As well as three varsity
              athletes, 2 NROTC midshipmen, 9 RA’s and 6 STAR Scholars.
            </p>
            <h2>Why Join a Fraternity?</h2>
            <p>
              “Almost everything I have needed to know about leadership for the
              Marine Corps, I learned in SigEp.” - General James T. Conway, 34th
              Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, Southeast Missouri
              State ‘69
            </p>
            <p>
              Now you might be thinking: “Why would someone join a fraternity?”
              Well consider this: 43 of the nation’s 50 largest corporations are
              run by CEO’s who were in fraternities, 76% of the United States
              Congress and Senate were in fraternities, and in the entire 20th
              century the United States only had 3 presidents who were not in
              fraternities.
            </p>
            <p>
              These numbers may seem baffling at first but when you consider
              what you gain by joining a fraternity they make more and more
              sense. Now, what do you gain? A nationwide, intergenerational
              network of alumni and students who are dedicated to our cardinal
              values: virtue, diligence and brotherly love. You will gain access
              to leadership seminars, conferences, guest speakers among other
              types of professional and academic resources you wouldn't have
              otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a member of SigEp you are provided with an opportunity to grow,
              mature and succeed every day. Our regular events include dinners
              with guest speakers, community service projects, multicultural
              and etiquette dinners, mixers with sororities and athletics in
              almost every field.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than wondering what we can do for you, we want you to
              wonder what can’t we do for you. With SigEp you get out what you
              put in, every day.
