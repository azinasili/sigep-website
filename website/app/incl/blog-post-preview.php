    <p>
      Adding to the long list of SigEp’s community service
      initiatives, our chapter is now pioneering an effort to improve
      the everyday lives of not only Drexel’s Greek life, but the
      university’s students as a whole. Partnering with Drexel’s
      student affairs office and Associate Dean John Cooke, SigEp is
      establishing a biweekly street cleaning project on Drexel’s 34th
      street.
