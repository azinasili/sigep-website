              <h2>About SigEp PABB</h2>
              <p>
                On November 14th, 1999, 37 men were brought before Brothers Erin
                Mullally and Ryan Elliot from Headquarters, to begin the first
                challenge along the journey of brotherhood, The Sigma Challenge.
                Brothers were eager, yet anxious, to build a brotherhood worthy
                to join the National Fraternity of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shortly after Brother Mullally returned to headquarters, the
                Brothers who were appointed to the executive board began to
                develop different ideas and beliefs of what the Fraternity
                should be; ideas and beliefs that contradicted those of our Oath
                of Obligation. Tension and dissent grew within the brotherhood,
                creating definitively separate groups with their own agenda,
                each trying to gain control of the Fraternity. Accompanying this
                internal struggle was the challenge the brothers faced from the
                Inter-Fraternal Council (IFC). The IFC was not given a choice
                whether or not to allow a new Fraternity onto campus and had no
                involvement with the selection of which Fraternity it would be.
                Members of IFC also over-heard a conversation that took place
                between members of SigEp and alumni, the topic of which IFC
                misinterpreted, and resulted in more animosity towards SigEp
                by the IFC.
              </p>
              <p>
                Marred by the negative relationship within the brotherhood, the
                lack of support from the IFC, and lack of confidence within
                themselves, 27 of the new members of the Drexel Sigma Epsilon
                Chapter decided they didn't want to accept the struggle that
                lay ahead.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the next meeting following Christmas break, only the
                following men showed up: Mohamed Al-Khalifa Khalifa, Martin
                Christian, Steven Goble, Jonathan Huynh, Robert Li, Michael
                Maslanik, Rahul Patel, Terrence Purnell, Jamie Rosley, and Ryan
                Turman. These 10 brothers are the founding fathers of the Sigma
                Epsilon Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity.
              </p>
